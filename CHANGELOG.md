## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffolding: working agreement, design overview, licence, notice, security policy and changelog.
- Minimum supported Python version set to 3.12.
- Packaging as `cognisn-warden` (import `warden`, typed), with a single version source in `warden.__version__` and `scripts/bump_version.py`, which stamps only on a matching `release/vX.Y.Z` branch.
- CI on Python 3.12 and 3.13: ruff, `mypy --strict`, the test suite against a real Postgres, and a licence audit (`scripts/licence_audit.py`) that refuses copyleft runtime dependencies, with psycopg (LGPL-3.0) as the one recorded exception.
